 * cache entry, a reference count is incremented but the structure

        perform 'heavyweight' (timed expiration of cached attributes,
        getattr-based directory trust) checks the first time after
        getting an inode.  It does all of the checks read-locked and
        only acquires a write lock if there's something requiring a
        change.

        There is a second light-weight check done before use of cached
        data that checks whether the bits saying that inode attributes
        or inode content are trustworthy have been cleared by, for
        example, FSAL_CB.

        To summarize, the current implementation is that policy-based
        trust of validity is checked once per logical series of
        operations at cache_inode_get, and asynchronous trust is
        checked with use (when the attributes are locked for reading,
