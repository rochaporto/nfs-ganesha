/* FSAL API

 */

/**
 * @page newapi New FSAL API
 *
 * @section structs Public and Private Data Structures
 *
 * Shared FSAL data structures have two definitions, one that is
 * global and passed around by the core, the other private which
 * included the global definition within it.
 *
 * All these data structures are passed back to the core with the
 * global pointer and dereferenced with container_of within the FSAL
 * itself like so:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *
 * struct private_obj_handle
 * {
 *         [private stuff]
 *         struct fsal_obj_handle *pub;
 * }
 *
 * fsal_getattr(struct fsal_obj_handle handle_pub,
 *              struct attrlist *attrs)
 * {
 *         struct private_obj_handle *handle;
 *
 *         handle = container_of(handle_pub,
 *                               struct private_obj_handle, pub);
 *         [ do stuff ]
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The @c container_of macro takes the public pointer/handle @c
 * handle_pub which is indicated as the element @c pub of structure
 * type @c private_obj_handle.  Throughout the function, where private
 * elements are dereferenced, the @c handle pointer is used.  The @c
 * handle_pub pointer is used in the public case.
 *
 * @section usage Object usage
 *
 * Mutex locks and reference counts are used to manage both concurrent
 * usage and state.  The reference counts are use to determine when
 * the object is "free".  Current use is for managing ref counts and
 * lists.  This will be expanded, though many cases are already
 * handled by the locks in Cache inode.
 *
 * Since we cannot create objects out of thin air, there is an order
 * based on one object being the "context" in which the other is
 * created.  In other words, a @c fsal_export is created from the @c
 * fsal_module that connects it to the backing store (filesystem). The
 * same applies to a @c fsal_obj_handle that only makes sense for a
 * specific 'fsal_export'.
 *
 * When an object is created, it is returned with a reference already
 * taken.  The callee of the creating method must then either keep a
 * persistent reference to it or @c put it back.  For example, a @c
 * fsal_export gets created for each export in the configuration.  A
 * pointer to it gets saved in @c exportlist__ and it has a reference
 * to reflect this.  It is now safe to use it to do a @c lookup which
 * will return a @c fsal_obj_handle which can then be kept in a cache
 * inode entry.  If we had done a @c put on the export, it could be
 * freed at any point and make a @c lookup using it unsafe.
 *
 * In addition to a reference count, object that create other objects
 * have a list of all the objects they create.  This serves two
 * purposes. The obvious case is to keep the object "busy" until all
 * of its children are freed.  Second, it provides a means to visit
 * all of the objects it creates.
 *
 * Every object has a pointer to its parent.  This is used for such
 * things as managing the object list and for calling methods on the
 * parent.
 *
 * @section versioning Versioning
 *
 * One intent in this API is to be able to support fsals that are built
 * out-of-tree and possibly out of synch with the core of Ganesha.  This
 * is managed by version numbers in this file that are validated at load
 * time for the fsal.  There are major and minor version numbers which are
 * monotonically increasing numbers ( V1 < V2 means V2 is newer).
 *
 * API guarantee:
 *
 * * If major version numbers differ, the fsal will not be loaded because
 *   the api has changed enough to make it unsafe.
 *
 * * If the major versions are equal, the minor version determines loadability.
 *
 *   - A fsal that is older than the Ganesha core can safely load and run.
 *
 *   - A fsal that is newer than the Ganesha core is not safe and will not
 *     be loaded.
 *
 *
 * @section vector Operation Vectors
 *
 * Each structure carries with it an @c ops pointer.  Default
 * operation vectors are created at FSAL moduel initialziation time,
 * and may be overridden there.  Individual exports or handles may
 * have different operations vectors, but they should all be derived
 * from the module operations vector.
 *
 *	This vector is used to access methodsm e.g.:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * exp_hdl->ops->lookup(exp_hdl, name, ...);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that exp_hdl is used to dereference the method and it is also
 * *always* the first argument to the method/function.  Think of it as
 * the 'this' argument.
